\usage{
UMAP(data, n.neighbours = 10, min.dist = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A code{\link{data.frame}} or numeric \code{\link{matrix}} containing the data to be
analyzed with each case as a row and each variable as a column.}

\item{n.neighbours}{A coefficient which determines the number of neighboring points used in local
approximations of manifold structured.}

\item{min.dist}{Controls how tightly the embedding is allowed compress points together.}
}
\description{
Produce a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection embedding.
